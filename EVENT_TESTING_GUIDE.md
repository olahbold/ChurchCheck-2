# Event Management Module Testing Guide

## âœ… Current Status
The Event Management Module has been fully implemented and fixed with comprehensive validation and error handling.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Fixes Applied
1. **Schema Validation**: Fixed Zod schema to handle nullable optional fields
2. **Database Integration**: Proper handling of empty strings converted to null values
3. **API Endpoints**: Complete CRUD operations with authentication and church context
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and toast notifications
5. **UI Components**: Full event management interface with form validation

## ðŸ“‹ Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complete Event Creation
**Test**: Create event with all fields filled
- Event Name: "Sunday Morning Service"
- Event Type: "Sunday Service"
- Description: "Weekly worship service"
- Location: "Main Sanctuary"
- Organizer: "Pastor John"
- Start Date: "2025-08-10"
- End Date: "2025-08-10"
- Start Time: "10:00"
- End Time: "12:00"
- Active: âœ“

**Expected**: Event created successfully with toast notification

### Scenario 2: Minimal Event Creation
**Test**: Create event with only required fields
- Event Name: "Prayer Meeting"
- Event Type: "Prayer Meeting"
- All other fields: empty
- Active: âœ“

**Expected**: Event created successfully, empty fields stored as null

### Scenario 3: Event Update/Edit
**Test**: Edit existing event
- Change name, description, times
- Leave some fields empty
- Update location and organizer

**Expected**: Event updated successfully with proper validation

### Scenario 4: Event Type Variations
**Test**: Create events for each type
- Sunday Service
- Prayer Meeting
- Bible Study
- Youth Group
- Special Event
- Other

**Expected**: All event types work correctly with proper badges

### Scenario 5: Active/Inactive Status
**Test**: Toggle event active status
- Create active event
- Deactivate event
- Verify it doesn't appear in check-in dropdown
- Reactivate event

**Expected**: Status changes properly affect check-in availability

### Scenario 6: Event-Based Check-in
**Test**: Use events in check-in flow
- Navigate to Check-in tab
- Verify event dropdown populated with active events
- Select event and check-in member
- Verify attendance record includes event ID

**Expected**: Check-in requires event selection and creates proper attendance records

### Scenario 7: Event Management Interface
**Test**: Full admin interface functionality
- Events tab in Admin section
- Event statistics display
- Event filtering (All/Active/Inactive)
- Event deletion
- Event editing modal

**Expected**: Complete interface functionality with proper role-based access

### Scenario 8: Error Handling
**Test**: Invalid data scenarios
- Invalid time formats (should be handled gracefully)
- Missing required fields
- Database connection issues
- Permission errors

**Expected**: Proper error messages and user feedback
